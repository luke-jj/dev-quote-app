## Installation
The Composer dependency manager for PHP is required.

Use Composer to install all necessary dependencies by running `composer install`
in the project folder root.

If PHP is installed and set-up in your environment simple run `php -S
localhost:8888` in the project folder root to start a local php server, or
use MAMP, XAMP, or a similar software package to run the php and webserver.

## Usage
Simply access the web app through the browser. (url: `localhost:8888`, if
you are running a simple php server as described above.)
